# Introduction and Welcome

Hello! Welcome! It's really wonderful that you have chosen to spend your time here celebrating this occasion with Emmy and Chris.

With this ceremony, we set aside a few moments in time to stop and allow ourselves to think about, to meditate on, the power and impact of love. And in particular, the love that has brought Emily Vallandingham and Christopher Jedras together today. 

So let's ruminate just a bit on the concept of love. What is love? For inspiration, let's hear how a few authors and poets define this strange and mystical force:

Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, a French poet and author of _The Little Prince_ wrote in another of his works, _Airman’s Odyssey_ :

*Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, in Airman’s Odyssey:*

>Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction. 

*Shakespeare, in A Midsummer Night’s Dream:*

>Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind.

Anaïs Nin, a bold author, who sought to find a language for otherwise wordless instincts and feelings said this:

*Anaïs Nin, in A Literate Passion:*

>What is love but acceptance of the other, whatever he is.

Finally, 

*Agatha Christie, in her autobiography*

>It is a curious thought, but it is only when you see people looking ridiculous that you realize just how much you love them.

As we hear these people's thoughts, and as we ponder ourselves, about what love means to us personally, we start to see different facets of love. Love is a many-faceted thing. Each time we experience it, we see a slightly different glimpse of it. A different perspective on love. I think an appreciation for the details of this subject takes many encounters with love - which is to say, it takes a long time.

So, like all of us, Chris and Emmy have a lot to learn about love. But they are now starting down a path towards learning more about this great and powerful component of their lives, by sharing it with one another.

In a relationship, one mind revises the other; one heart changes its partner. Who we are and who we become depends, in part, on whom we love.

This is scary. This is hard to understand, hard to believe, hard to accept. But this reality is also very exciting. It means you, Emmy, can be vulnerable. You can let go with Chris. You can be you with Chris. It means you, Chris, can open up. You can be contented with Emmy. You can be you with Emmy. 

In fact you _will_ be yourself with Chris. And you _will_ be yourself with Emmy.

Real, honest, complete love requires letting go.

# First Reading

## Love Lives

*John Clare (1793-1864)*

>Love lives beyond

>The tomb, the earth, which fades like dew.

>I love the fond,

>The faithful, and the true

>Love lives in sleep,

>The happiness of healthy dreams

>Eve's dews may weep,

>But love delightful seems.

>‘Tis heard in spring

>When light and sunbeams, warm and kind,

>On angels’ wing

>Bring love and music to the mind.

>And where is voice,

>So young, so beautiful and sweet

>As nature’s choice,

>Where Spring and lovers meet?

>Love lives beyond 

>The tomb, the earth, the flowers, and dew.

>I love the fond, 

>The faithful, young and true.

# Declaration of Intent

Will you pledge to her your love, faith and tenderness,

# Second Reading

##Truth and Beauty

John Hogben

>Two souls there are in nature and in life – 

>The soul of Beauty and the soul of Truth;

>Towards which we yearn and strain with restless strife,

>Along paths fraught with malice or with ruth; - 

>In the red face of ridicule and scorn, 

>Men sought, and still must seek these – or within,

>(In spite of all earth’s sorrow and her sin),

>The soul is to search and manner born.

>And still, in looking Beauty in the face,

>With strong Prophetic joy we recognise

>Something of what we may be, as we trace

>Our own dim shadow in her lustrous eyes;

>Nor may we part such with a dull harsh rule –

>Beauty is true and Truth is Beautiful!

# Ring Warming

Now Chris and Emmy would like you all to play a small part in this service. All of you are friend, family, loved ones. All of you have touched the lives of Chris and Emmy in ways that cannot be described in words. 

The rings will be passed around now, starting on either end of the 'aisles'. If you have a prayer, wish, or meditation you would like to give to Chris and Emmy, do so when you are handed the ring and then pass it to the person next to you.

The symbolism in this gesture is one of unity and connectedness. By being together today, we are all part of a community, a family, centered around Emmy and Chris today. 

But your *out* of the family if you loose the ring.

# Third Reading or Marriage Blessing

## Marriage Advise

*Jane Wells (1886)*

>Let your love be stronger than your hate or anger.

>Learn the wisdom of compromise, for it is better to bend a little than to break.

>Believe the best rather than the worst.

>People have a way of living up or down to your opinion of them.

>Remember that true friendship is the basis for any lasting relationship.
