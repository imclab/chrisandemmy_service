# First Reading

## Love Lives

*John Clare (1793-1864)*

>Love lives beyond

>The tomb, the earth, which fades like dew.

>I love the fond,

>The faithful, and the true

>Love lives in sleep,

>The happiness of healthy dreams

>Eve’s dews may weep,

>But love delightful seems.

>‘Tis heard in spring

>When light and sunbeams, warm and kind,

>On angels’ wing

>Bring love and music to the mind.

>And where is voice,

>So young, so beautiful and sweet

>As nature’s choice,

>Where Spring and lovers meet?

>Love lives beyond 

>The tomb, the earth, the flowers, and dew.

>I love the fond, 

>The faithful, young and true.

# Second Reading

##Truth and Beauty

John Hogben

>Two souls there are in nature and in life – 

>The soul of Beauty and the soul of Truth;

>Towards which we yearn and strain with restless strife,

>Along paths fraught with malice or with ruth; - 

>In the red face of ridicule and scorn, 

>Men sought, and still must seek these – or within,

>(In spite of all earth’s sorrow and her sin),

>The soul is to search and manner born.

>And still, in looking Beauty in the face,

>With strong Prophetic joy we recognise

>Something of what we may be, as we trace

>Our own dim shadow in her lustrous eyes;

>Nor may we part such with a dull harsh rule –

>Beauty is true and Truth is Beautiful!

## Marriage Advise

*Jane Wells (1886)*

>Let your love be stronger than your hate or anger.
Learn the wisdom of compromise, for it is better to bend a little than to break.
Believe the best rather than the worst.
People have a way of living up or down to your opinion of them.
Remember that true friendship is the basis for any lasting relationship.
The person you choose to marry is deserving of the courtesies and kindness you bestow on your friends. 
Please hand this down to your children and your children’s children.
