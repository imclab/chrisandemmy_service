# First Reading

## Love Lives

*John Clare (1793-1864)*

>Love lives beyond

>The tomb, the earth, which fades like dew.

>I love the fond,

>The faithful, and the true

>Love lives in sleep,

>The happiness of healthy dreams

>Eve’s dews may weep,

>But love delightful seems.

>‘Tis heard in spring

>When light and sunbeams, warm and kind,

>On angels’ wing

>Bring love and music to the mind.

>And where is voice,

>So young, so beautiful and sweet

>As nature’s choice,

>Where Spring and lovers meet?

>Love lives beyond 

>The tomb, the earth, the flowers, and dew.

>I love the fond, 

>The faithful, young and true.

# Second Reading

##Truth and Beauty

John Hogben

>Two souls there are in nature and in life – 

>The soul of Beauty and the soul of Truth;

>Towards which we yearn and strain with restless strife,

>Along paths fraught with malice or with ruth; - 

>In the red face of ridicule and scorn, 

>Men sought, and still must seek these – or within,

>(In spite of all earth’s sorrow and her sin),

>The soul is to search and manner born.

>And still, in looking Beauty in the face,

>With strong Prophetic joy we recognise

>Something of what we may be, as we trace

>Our own dim shadow in her lustrous eyes;

>Nor may we part such with a dull harsh rule –

>Beauty is true and Truth is Beautiful!

## Marriage Advise

*Jane Wells (1886)*

>Let your love be stronger than your hate or anger.

>Learn the wisdom of compromise, for it is better to bend a little than to break.

>Believe the best rather than the worst.

>People have a way of living up or down to your opinion of them.

>Remember that true friendship is the basis for any lasting relationship.

>The person you choose to marry is deserving of the courtesies and kindness you bestow on your friends. 

>Please hand this down to your children and your children’s children.
